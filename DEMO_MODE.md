# ðŸš€ Demo Mode - Quick Testing Guide

## Instant Testing Without Setup

Demo Mode lets you test the app immediately without creating an account or setting up Supabase.

## How to Use Demo Mode

### Step 1: Make Sure Supabase is Set Up

You still need to run the database schema in Supabase (one-time setup):

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/uztehmamkyawmbghtncz/sql/new
2. Copy the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
3. Paste and click **Run**

### Step 2: Start the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Click Demo Mode

1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Click the **"ðŸš€ Demo Mode (Test Without Account)"** button
3. You're in! No email, no password needed.

## What Demo Mode Does

- âœ… Automatically creates a demo account (if needed)
- âœ… Logs you in instantly
- âœ… Full access to all features
- âœ… Same experience as a real user
- âœ… Data persists between sessions

## Demo Account Details

2. Scroll to **"Email Auth"**
3. Toggle **OFF** "Confirm email"
4. Click **Save**

Now all sign-ups are instant (no email verification needed).
