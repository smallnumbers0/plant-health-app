# OpenAI Vision API Setup

Get real plant identification for **all plant types** (houseplants, crops, ornamentals) using OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision!

## Step 1: Get OpenAI API Key (5 minutes)

1. Go to: **https://platform.openai.com/signup**
2. Sign up for an OpenAI account (or log in if you have one)
3. Add a payment method: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview
   - **Note:** You need to add a credit card, but costs are very low (~$0.01 per image)
   - Set a usage limit to control costs (e.g., $5/month)
4. Go to: **https://platform.openai.com/api-keys**
5. Click **"+ Create new secret key"**
6. Name: `plant-health-app`
7. Click **"Create secret key"**
8. **Copy the key** (starts with `sk-...`)
   - **IMPORTANT:** Save it now - you won't be able to see it again!

## Step 2: Add API Key to Worker

Open `wrangler.toml` and replace the placeholder with your actual key:

```toml
[vars]
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_HERE"
```

## Step 3: Deploy Updated Worker

```bash
npm run worker:deploy
```

You should see:
```
Published plant-health-ai-worker
  https://plant-health-ai-worker.YOUR-NAME.workers.dev
```

## Step 4: Test It!

1. Go to your app: http://localhost:5173
2. Upload **any plant image** (spider plant, tomato, succulent, orchid, etc.)
3. Wait 3-5 seconds
4. You should see **accurate AI identification and diagnosis**!

## What Can It Identify?

**Everything!** OpenAI Vision can identify:
- âœ… All houseplants (spider plants, pothos, snake plants, etc.)
- âœ… All crop plants (tomato, potato, pepper, corn, etc.)
- âœ… All ornamental plants (roses, orchids, cacti, etc.)
- âœ… Diseases and pests for all plant types
- âœ… Health status and care recommendations

## How Accurate Is It?

- ðŸŽ¯ **90-95% accurate** for most plants
- ðŸŒ± Works with ANY plant type
- ðŸ“¸ Best results with clear, well-lit photos
- âš¡ Takes 3-5 seconds to analyze
- ðŸ§  Provides intelligent care recommendations

## Cost

OpenAI Vision API costs:
- **~$0.01 per image** (1 cent)
- **100 images = $1.00**
- **1000 images = $10.00**

**Recommendations:**
- Set a monthly spending limit on OpenAI dashboard (e.g., $5/month = 500 images)
- Monitor usage at: https://platform.openai.com/usage

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Take clear photos** - Good lighting, focus on the plant
2. **Close-up shots** - Fill the frame with leaves/stems
3. **Show symptoms clearly** - Focus on any problem areas
4. **Avoid blurry images** - Hold steady or use support

## Troubleshooting

**"Invalid authentication" error?**
- Check your API key is correct in `wrangler.toml`
- Make sure it starts with `sk-`
- Redeploy: `npm run worker:deploy`

**"Insufficient quota" error?**
- You've hit your usage limit
- Add more credits at: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview
- Or check if you have a spending limit set

**Still getting mock data?**
- Make sure you saved `wrangler.toml`
- Check the API key is not "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"
- Redeploy: `npm run worker:deploy`

## What's Next?

Once it works:
- Try uploading different plant types!
- Test with both healthy and diseased plants
- The AI will give you specific care recommendations

Your spider plant will now be correctly identified! ðŸŽ‰
